### How I Plan to Use the Project Board to Track the *Portfolio* Project's Progress

1. **Visual Task Overview**  
   The board provides a clear visual representation of all tasks and their current status (To Do, In Progress, Done). This allows me to quickly assess which tasks are pending, which are being worked on, and which are completed.

2. **Task Assignment and Accountability**  
   Each task is assigned to a specific team member, ensuring accountability. Team members will update the status of their tasks by moving them across columns, making it clear who is responsible for what.

3. **Priority Management**  
   The board helps prioritize tasks. By organizing tasks in the **To Do** column, I can reorder them based on urgency, ensuring the most important tasks are tackled first.

4. **Collaboration and Communication**  
   The project board enables team members to communicate through comments on issues, asking questions or providing updates. This keeps everyone informed and ensures smooth collaboration.

5. **Progress Tracking**  
   Moving tasks to the **In Progress** and **Done** columns allows for real-time tracking of project progress. I can easily monitor how much work has been completed and how much is still left to do, ensuring the project stays on schedule.
